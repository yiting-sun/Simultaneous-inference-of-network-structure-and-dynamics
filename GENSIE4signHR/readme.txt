üìÅ Folder Description

The data in ./data/ are generated by generate_sign_HR.py.

The Figure 1 in the main paper is reproduced using Simultaneous_Inference_HR.ipynb.
To rerun the experiment, simply update the data_path and save_path variables and execute the notebook.

The corresponding training script is train_sign_HR.py.
Training outputs are saved to:

'./Training_process/recorded_models.pt'

'./Training_process/weights_tau0.999.pkl'

üß© Extended Model

We also provide Simultaneous_Inference_HR_general_model.ipynb, which uses the revised model Get_sign_MP (defined in model.py).

Before running this notebook, execute train_sign_HR_general_model.py to generate and save:

inferred edge weights './Training_process/weights_tau0.999_lam0.0001_20251013_191841.pkl' (replace with your parameters)

pretrained elementary modules './Training_process/recorded_models_lam0.0001_20251013_191841.pt' (replace with your parameters)

Then run Simultaneous_Inference_HR_general_model.ipynb to train each module precisely using the classified edge signs and types, yielding more accurate results.
