Data in path './data/ is generated by generate_sign_HR.py.

The figure1 in main paper is run by file Simultaneous_Inference_HR.ipynb.
Change the data_path and save_path, and reproduce the results.

The training file we used for this figure is train_sign_HR.py. 
The training process are saved in path './Training_process/recorded_models.pt' and './Training_process/weights_tau0.999.pkl'.

======================================

We prepare another file Simultaneous_Inference_HR_general_model.ipynb for revised model 'Get_sign_MP' in model.py.
Before running this program, you should run the program for saving the recorded edge weights and elementary trained modules.

Run Simultaneous_Inference_HR_general_model.ipynb.
Use the classified sign edge and edge type to train modules precisely to get more accurate module results.
